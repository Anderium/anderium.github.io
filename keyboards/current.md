# Current setup

I'll describe my current setup here, but unfortunately it's not anything interesting at the moment.  As of right now,
my daily driver is the built-in keyboard of my laptop with QWERTY.  I do not even have caps-lock and escape swapped,
because I use CAPS a lot when I have a few capital letters to type and I do not use Emacs or [Vim] where having escape
close would make sense.
