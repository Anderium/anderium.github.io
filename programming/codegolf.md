# CodeGolf

**CodeGolf**, or **Golfing**, refers to the process of writing code that minimises the number of characters in the
solution.  It's a common hobby for people programming in weird languages, and pretty fun to try.  I've written a few
things on it for [brainfuck] and [Taxi].

You can find places to do golfing anywhere on the internet, but codegolf.stackexchange.com is a common place for many
languages and challenges.
