# Esoteric programming languages

Esoteric programming languages are languages that have been created not to be efficient or useful for a task, but to be
fun.  They often involve a gimmick that makes them weird or difficult to use.  I believe the most well known esoteric
languages is [brainfuck], which uses only 8 characters, but is Turing complete.  There are many things written about it
already, and many resources to learn from.  *bla blah.

Two other esoteric languages I like are [Taxi] and [piet].  The first requires you to create a schedule for picking up
passengers in a small town and the latter asks you to create abstract 2D art.  There's a lot of variety to find.
