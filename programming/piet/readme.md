# piet

The programming language [Piet] is for creating abstract art that can function as a program.  Piet programs are images,
where each codel (square group of pixels) has a meaning.

You can find a great editor on [piet.bubbler.space].

## TODO

This section will be expanded, I will probably amend the commit and force push this, but I just want this already rather
large commit out of my queue at the moment.  :smile:

## Golfing

Golfing refers to the process of writing code that minimises the number of characters in the solution.  It's a common
hobby for people programming in weird languages, and pretty fun to try.  For this language, there are multiple things
that golfing can mean.  Firstly you can try to minimise the area of the program.  Secondly, you can try to minimise the
number of characters in the [ascii-piet] translation.  In both cases, your best option is to have a wide program with
very little height.  (The minimum height is 2, but 3 can be better depending on the loop.)
