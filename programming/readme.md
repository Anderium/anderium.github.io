# Programming

That's a very broad term.  I don't really know why I made this section, I just feel like I have a lot of things that I
could write about programming that wouldn't fit in any of the categories I have right now, so a general category it is.

I love [esoteric] programming languages and doing [codegolf], so you will probably find a lot of that on here.

If you're interested, I also have a page on [numpy shape typing][numpy-shape-typing], which I think is an interesting
read if you're interested in Python type hints.

[codegolf]: ./codegolf.md
