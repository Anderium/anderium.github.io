# Vim

You know vim, don't lie.

If you don't, you don't know it's called vim.

If you still don't, have you never had merge conflicts?  Teach me your ways.

## What's vim

Okay, end of joke.  What's vim?  Vim is a code editor just like VS Code, but instead of being GUI based, it runs in
your terminal and you use commmands to do most of the complex editing.  You will usually find only people that know
nothing of how to use vim OR vim powerusers, but no one ever™ falls in-between.  I'm one of the first group, that
doesn't know how to use vim except how to edit, save and exit.

Vim should be very powerful because it's very customisable, but there's also different flavours of vim and I believe
also things that you can consider extensions.  Actually, there are many code editors that support vim like commands.
Vim itself is also based on an even older editor called vi, but I don't know what the difference is.

If you've heard of vim, you should also hear about Emacs.  Emacs is something I know even less about, but from what I
can tell it should probably have a syntaxt for commands that feels more logical, but may be more verbose.  Don't quote
me on that though, just know that Emacs is a thing and you will recognise when people talk about it.

Lastly, I should probably mention nano.  If you've ever looked up how to exit vim online, you will probably find
answers that tell you to use nano instead and how to set up git to use a different terminal editor than vim by default.
Nano is pretty nice if you just want to quickly edit a file, but it's way less powerful than your default editor.  
(Whether that default is vim, Emacs or a GUI based editor.)
