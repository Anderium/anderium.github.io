# anderium's site

Welcome to my GitHub Pages site, where I might put all kinds of things or I might not.
I've got no clue how Pages works and I'm not going to use this often enough to learn every bit there is to it.
If there's anything I can improve, this is a public repo, so you can submit a PR and I'll take a look.

Most subdirectories will probably not have anything in common, but you can obviously still visit them all by looking at the directories I have.
Some might not be in English though, I'm learning Toki Pona and natively speak Dutch.
