# Created sudokus

This is, for now, a short list without any introduction.  One day I'll get around to writing that as well, surely.

I meant to create a consistent naming scheme for my sudokus, so I attempted to find names of old games that fit the
intended solution path for the puzzles.  I didn't succeed, because the feeling each sudoku gives off doesn't fit with
the names I could think of.  Instead, all my sudokus are written in small caps.
