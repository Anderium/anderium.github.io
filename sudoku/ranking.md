# Solved puzzle ranking

This is a ranking of puzzles I've [solved].  Maybe don't take it too seriously as I didn't put that much time into
consistent ranking.  Criteria are rather abitrary.  Note: spoilers will be in the notes.  Note 2: Ranked based on sum of
individual criteria first, then enjoyment followed by difficulty.

Puzzle                   | Total | Enjoyment | Good difficulty | Creativity required | Notes
-------------------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------
 Fog, Deconstructed      | 43/50 |   16/20   |  18/20 (hard)   |        9/10         | There are a few difficult things to spot at the start and the end, but thinking about the empty cell constraints in combination with killer cages is super fun!
 Benebelte Nachbarschaft | 41/50 |   17/20   |  16/20 (hard)   |        8/10         | Incredibly fun, wish I wasn't sick when solving it.  The coloured “Renban” lines give a nice solving strategy.  A few points that are choke points.
 Wormhole (remix)        | 39/50 |   18/20   |  14/20 (hard)   |        7/10         | The effect of box 9 on box 6 and 7 was super interesting.  Also the wormholes for box 2 and then box 1.  Used lots of letters during my solve.
 Decimation              | 38/50 |   14/20   |  18/20 (right)  |        6/10         | This was a great puzzle with negative constraints, I love those. It was rather tedious to solve, because you're thinking in pairs and colouring a lot of them instead of solving with the digits.
 Secrets and Lines       | 38/50 |   14/20   |  16/20 (hard)   |        8/10         | Pretty nice puzzle.  I was slow during my solve, but I could feel the puzzle had a good flow anyway.  It's crazy what people can come up with and the fact that we can solve it too.
 Unique Sum Sudoku       | 35/50 |   15/20   |  13/20 (hard)   |        7/10         | Only a four by four grid! Surprisingly difficult, but I missed some ideas at the start that would've helped me a lot. The 9 is the only digit missing, poor 9.
 Circles and Thermos     | 33/50 |   14/20   |  12/20 (hard)   |        7/10         | Some creativity required, but also a lot of brute-forcing for me.  I didn't find it particularly easy to determine the next cells to narrow down on.
 Fog X                   | 33/50 |   13/20   |  14/20 (easy)   |        6/10         | Just a silly puzzle, mostly.  There are still a few surprising tricks to use in your solve, though.  Chameleon is a lovely troll.
 Wheels on the Bus       | 31/50 |    9/20   |  16/20 (right)  |        6/10         | Once you realise the idea of parity for the wheels because they all have the same digit on the west, it becomes almost tedious.  Or maybe I juts did it badly?
 Double The Mines        | 24/50 |   11/20   |   8/20 (hard)   |        5/10         | This was too difficut for me, I think in large because the double orthogonal shading constraint was entirely new for me.  Also, I was exhausted when solving this puzzle, which definitely made me miss a lot of obvious clues.
 Cascade                 | 19/50 |    6/20   |   5/20 (blind)  |        8/10         | Unfortuantely, I was blind to the most important trick in the puzzle, so I didn't know which way the 89 pair was until rather late.  Still had some very nice patterns to spot, but I usually attempted—while failing—to bruteforce first.  Box 6 was especially problematic for me, although the final stretch wasn't smooth sailing either, for some reason.
