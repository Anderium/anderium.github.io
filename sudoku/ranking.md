# Solved puzzle ranking

This is a ranking of puzzles I've [solved].  Maybe don't take it too seriously as I didn't put that much time into
consistent ranking.  Criteria are rather abitrary.  Note: spoilers will be in the notes.

Puzzle              | Total | Enjoyment | Good difficulty | Creativity required | Notes
--------------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|-------
 Fog, Deconstructed | 43/50 |   16/20   |    18/20 (hard) |        9/10         | There are a few difficult things to spot at the start and the end, but thinking about the empty cell constraints in combination with killer cages is super fun!
  Wormhole (remix)  | 39/50 |   18/20   |    14/20 (hard) |        7/10         | The effect of box 9 on box 6 and 7 was super interesting.  Also the wormholes for box 2 and then box 1.  Used lots of letters during my solve.
       Fog X        | 33/50 |   13/20   |    14/20 (easy) |        6/10         | Just a silly puzzle, mostly.  There are still a few surprising tricks to use in your solve, though.  Chameleon is a lovely troll.
  Double The Mines  | 24/50 |   11/20   |     8/20 (hard) |        5/10         | This was too difficut for me, I think in large because the double orthogonal shading constraint was entirely new for me.  Also, I was exhausted when solving this puzzle, which definitely made me miss a lot of obvious clues.
      Cascade       | 19/50 |    6/20   |   5/20 (blind)  |        8/10         | Unfortuantely, I was blind to the most important trick in the puzzle, so I didn't know which way the 89 pair was until rather late.  Still had some very nice patterns to spot, but I usually attempted—although failing—to bruteforce first.  Box 6 was especially problematic for me, although the final stretch wasn't smooth sailing either, for some reason.
