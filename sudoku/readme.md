# Sudoku

You know what sudokus are, right?  Well, there's more to sudoku than just having a grid with numbers.  Variants exist
that make it a lot more interesting.  Examples including killer sudoku where cages are drawn and digits within should
sum to the given totals.  I find these sudokus a lot more interesting, and I was introduced to them by the YouTube
channel [Cracking The Cryptic][ctc].  I struggle with the harder ones on their channel, and I don't have time to try
each of them, but I do solve some of them on my own and some with a few hints.  I thought I would make a collection of
the ones I solved here, to see my achievements.  The ones I did first I'm not sure how much help I used, and I'm quite
sure there are some I didn't include because I didn't keep track.

Now, there's actually a family of variants I like a lot more than killer sudokus, which are “negative constraints”.
Usually, you only need forward thinking to solve a sudoku.  I.e: “if these two cells form a pair, those digits cannot
occur anywhere else in the box/row/column.”  With negative constraints you get reasoning patterns that feel very
different and that I cannot explain succinctly.  The easiest variant to see the effect of negative constraints is the
ratio sudoku.  I actually created multiple of these sudoku myself, and I think they're also pretty nice.  Because I
wanted a place to share them, I added them to pages as well.
