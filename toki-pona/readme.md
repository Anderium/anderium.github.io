# toki pona

The constructed language toki pona contains incredibly few words.  Instead of being precise, the concept of the
language is to have ambiguity be resolved by context.  Although it's been a while since I've practiced the words and
even more so the grammar, I watched all tutorial videos of jan Misali on YouTube.  If you want to learn too, as of 2022
he is making an updated version that may help you learn better!

I would translate the text above into something like:

> toki pona li toki pana.  toki pona li kulupu nimi lili.

Although translating this back to English would make me interpret the text as something like:

> Toki pona is a made-up language with a small vocabulary.

Some day when I am better at writing toki pona, I will translate the whole first paragraph, but for now that seems
out of reach for me without major mistakes.  (I know, mistakes are how you learn, but I don't even have the knowledge
to translate in this case.)

There have even been developed multiple writing systems for toki pona.  For instance a logographic script and a script
meant to look nice and delicious.  The Discord server “ma toki pi toki pona” even has emotes for all words in the
logographic script!
